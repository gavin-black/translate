Allow translation of different types of media, currently focusing on VNs

Some ideas that have been floating around I'd like to integrate:
  * Use video of bilingual people going through media
  * Allow very granular changes and editing
  * Easy rollback of changes from improper edits
  * Incremental patches of current progress
